This paper presents a case study about machine learning on microcontrollers, with a focus on human activity recognition using accelerometer data. We build machine learning classifiers suitable for execution on modern microcontrollers and evaluate their performance. Specifically, we compare Random Forests ({RF}), a classical machine learning technique, with Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}), in terms of classification accuracy and inference speed. The results show that {RF} classifiers achieve similar levels of classification accuracy while being several times faster than a small custom {CNN} model designed for the task. The {RF} and the custom {CNN} are also several orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art deep learning models. On the one hand, these findings confirm the feasibility of using deep learning on modern microcontrollers. On the other hand, they cast doubt on whether deep learning is the best approach for this application, especially if high inference speed and, thus, low energy consumption is the key objective.},

We evaluate the model and the algorithms using Random Forest classifiers to quantify the recognition accuracy, and find that the multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm achieves the best results for the task. The results show that by selecting appropriate groups of features, energy consumption for computation and data transmission is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with the raw-data approach, and that the framework presents a flexible selection of feature groups that allow the designer to choose an appropriate accuracy-energy trade-off for a specific target application.},

Unfortunately, the computational cost of these ranking models is high. Thus, several works already proposed solutions aiming at improving the efficiency of the scoring process by dealing with features and peculiarities of modern {CPUs} and memory hierarchies. In this paper, we present {QuickScorer}, a new algorithm that adopts a novel bitvector representation of the tree-based ranking model, and performs an interleaved traversal of the ensemble by means of simple logical bitwise operations. The performance of the proposed algorithm are unprecedented, due to its cache-aware approach, both in terms of data layout and access patterns, and to a control flow that entails very low branch mis-prediction rates. The experiments on real Learning-to-Rank datasets show that {QuickScorer} is able to achieve speedups over the best state-of-the-art baseline ranging from 2x to 6.5x.},

	abstract = {Electrified vehicles users may expect their vehicle to have a steady autonomy range and available power throughout the lifetime of their cars. The health assessment of Lithium-ion batteries ({LIBs}), in that regard, represents a critical point for performance evaluation and lifetime prediction. Reliable state-of-health ({SoH}) assessment is essential to ensure cautious and suitable use of {LIBs}. To that end, several embedded solutions are proposed in the literature. In this paper, two new aging indicators are developed to enrich the existing diagnosis-based ({DB}-{SoH}) solutions. These indicators are based on collected data during charging ({CDB}-{SoH}) and driving ({DDB}-{SoH}) events overtime. The data are comprised of variables such as distance, speed, temperature, charging power, and more. Both solutions produce reliable state-of-health {SoH} assessment with a significantly good estimation error. Additionally, a data-driven battery aging prediction using the random forest ({RF}) algorithm is introduced using actual usersâ€™ behavior and ambient conditions. The proposed solution produced an {SoH} estimation error of 1.27\%. Finally, a method for aging factors ranking is proposed. The obtained order is consistent with known aging root causes in the literature and can be used to mitigate fast {LIB} aging for electrified vehicle applications.},

This article addresses the optimization of the computational and storage costs for running {DTs} on the microcontroller units ({MCUs}) typically deployed in {TinyML} scenarios. We introduce three alternative {DT} kernels optimized for memory- and compute-limited {MCUs}, providing insight into the key memory-latency tradeoffs on an open-source {RISC}-V platform. We identify key bottlenecks and demonstrate that {SW} optimizations enable up to significant memory footprint and latency decrease. Experimental results show that the optimized kernels achieve up to 4.5 {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}texts latency, 4.8{\textbackslash}times speedup, and 45\% storage reduction against the widely-adopted naive {DT} design. We carry out a detailed performance and energy cost analysis of various optimized {DT} variants: the best approach requires just 8 instructions and 0.155 {pJ} per decision.},

	abstract = {Random Forests ({RFs}) are widely used Machine Learning models in low-power embedded devices, due to their hardware friendly operation and high accuracy on practically relevant tasks. The accuracy of a {RF} often increases with the number of internal weak learners (decision trees), but at the cost of a proportional increase in inference latency and energy consumption. Such costs can be mitigated considering that, in most applications, inputs are not all equally difficult to classify. Therefore, a large {RF} is often necessary only for (few) hard inputs, and wasteful for easier ones. In this work, we propose an early-stopping mechanism for {RFs}, which terminates the inference as soon as a high-enough classification confidence is reached, reducing the number of weak learners executed for easy inputs. The early-stopping confidence threshold can be controlled at runtime, in order to favor either energy saving or accuracy. We apply our method to three different embedded classification tasks, on a single-core {RISC}-V microcontroller, achieving an energy reduction from 38\% to more than 90\% with a drop of less than 0.5\% in accuracy. We also show that our approach outperforms previous adaptive {ML} methods for {RFs}.},

	abstract = {Cow behavior recognition systems support the assessment of cowsâ€™ condition by providing their behavior information. Accelerometers are particularly suited for a non-invasive solution for the development of these monitoring systems. They are cheap and simple in setting up and providing high-performance recognition when using machine learning algorithms. The activity complexity of animals brings challenges in real context applications because different behaviors may have similar acceleration data. The reason is that they contain similar gestures, for example, feeding and standing. In our previous work, we proposed a cowsâ€™ behavior classifier based on leg-mounted acceleration data. The distinguishing of similar behaviors, such as feeding and standing, is limited by the data. This study presents a new efficient cow behavior recognition system based on combining leg-mounted and collar-mounted accelerometers. Significantly, the acceleration data from these two sensors were synchronized. Therefore, we can substantially expand the amount of information for classification purposes. Our approach identifies four cow behaviors: walking, feeding, lying, and standing. Random Forest algorithm with our extracted features (root mean square, standard deviation, and mean) and 16-second data window (a sample/second) offer excellent performance when identifying all concerning behaviors: feeding (0.914 accuracy, 0.884 sensitivity, 0.956 positive predictive value), lying (0.998, 0.996, 1), standing (0.88, 0.928, 0.842), and walking (0.998, 0.996, 0.998). These performances are better than other existing works, especially in our experiments with free-grazing cows.},

Accelerometer signals and Machine Learning techniques can be used to identify and observe behaviours of animals without the need for an exhaustive human observation which is labour intensive and time consuming. This study employed random forest algorithm to identify grazing, walking, scratching, and inactivity (standing, resting) of 8 Hebridean ewes located in Cheshire, Shotwick in the {UK}. We gathered accelerometer data from a sensor device which was fitted on the collar of the animals. The selection of the algorithm was based on previous research by which random forest achieved the best results among other benchmark techniques. Therefore, in this study, more focus was given to feature engineering to improve prediction performance. Seventeen features from time and frequency domain were calculated from the accelerometer measurements and the magnitude of the acceleration. Feature elimination was utilised in which highly correlated ones were removed, and only nine out of seventeen features were selected. The algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 99.43\% and a kappa value of 98.66\%. The accuracy for grazing, walking, scratching, and inactive was 99.08\%, 99.13\%, 99.90\%, and 99.85\%, respectively. The overall results showed that there is a significant improvement over previous methods and studies for all mutually exclusive behaviours. Those results are promising, and the technique could be further tested for future real-time activity recognition.},

This paves the way for the development of novel applications and services that do not need the omnipresent processing support from the cloud, which is power consuming and involves data security and privacy risks. In this work, a comprehensive review of the novel {TinyML} ecosystem is provided. The related challenges and opportunities are identified and the potential services that will be enabled by the development of truly smart frugal objects are discussed. As a main contribution of this paper, a detailed survey of the available {TinyML} frameworks for integrating {ML} algorithms within {MCUs} is provided. Besides, aiming at illustrating the given discussion, a real case study is presented. Concretely, we propose a multi-Radio Access Network ({RAT}) architecture for smart frugal objects. The issue of selecting the most adequate communication interface for sending sporadic messages considering both the status of the device and the characteristics of the data to be sent is addressed. To this end, several {TinyML} frameworks are evaluated and the performances of a number of {ML} algorithms embedded in an Arduino Uno board are analyzed. The attained results reveal the validity of the {TinyML} approach, which successfully enables the integration of techniques such as Neural Networks ({NNs}), Support Vector Machine ({SVM}), decision trees, or Random Forest ({RF}) in frugal objects with constrained hardware resources. The outcomes also show promising results in terms of algorithm's accuracy and computation performance.},

	abstract = {Accelerometers are a valuable tool for studying animal behaviour and physiology where direct observation is unfeasible. However, giving biological meaning to multivariate acceleration data is challenging. Here, we describe a method that reliably classifies a large number of behaviours using tri-axial accelerometer data collected at the low sampling frequency of 1â€…Hz, using the dingo (Canis dingo) as an example. We used out-of-sample validation to compare the predictive performance of four commonly used classification models (random forest, k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine, and naÃ¯ve Bayes). We tested the importance of predictor variable selection and moving window size for the classification of each behaviour and overall model performance. Random forests produced the highest out-of-sample classification accuracy, with our best-performing model predicting 14 behaviours with a mean accuracy of 87\%. We also investigated the relationship between overall dynamic body acceleration ({ODBA}) and the activity level of each behaviour, given the increasing use of {ODBA} in ecophysiology as a proxy for energy expenditure. {ODBA} values for our four â€˜high activityâ€™ behaviours were significantly greater than all other behaviours, with an overall positive trend between {ODBA} and intensity of movement. We show that a random forest model of relatively low complexity can mitigate some major challenges associated with establishing meaningful ecological conclusions from acceleration data. Our approach has broad applicability to free-ranging terrestrial quadrupeds of comparable size. Our use of a low sampling frequency shows potential for deploying accelerometers over extended time periods, enabling the capture of invaluable behavioural and physiological data across different ontogenies.},

Accelerometer data used in conjunction with machine learning algorithms have been the tool of choice for characterising animal behaviour. Although machine learning models perform reasonably well, they may not rely on meaningful features, nor lend themselves to physical interpretation of the classification rules. This lack of interpretability and control over classification outcomes is of particular concern where different behaviours have different frequency of occurrence and duration, as in most natural systems, and calls for the development of alternative methods. Biomechanical approaches to human activity classification could overcome these shortcomings, yet their full potential remains untapped for animal studies. We propose a general framework for behaviour recognition using accelerometers, and develop a hybrid model where (a) biomechanical features characterise movement dynamics, and (b) a node-based hierarchical classification scheme employs simple machine learning algorithms at each node to find feature-value thresholds separating different behaviours. Using triaxial accelerometer data collected on 10 wild Kalahari meerkats, and annotated video recordings of each individual as groundtruth, this hybrid model was validated in three scenarios: (a) when each behaviour was equally represented ({EQDIST}), (b) when naturally imbalanced datasets were considered ({STRAT}) and (c) when data from new individuals were considered ({LOIO}). A linear-kernel Support Vector Machine at each node of our classification scheme yielded an overall accuracy of {\textgreater}95\% for each scenario. Our hybrid approach had a 2.7\% better average overall accuracy than top-performing classical machine learning approaches. Further, we showed that not all models with high overall accuracy returned accurate behaviour-specific performance, and good performance during {EQDIST} did not always generalise to {STRAT} and {LOIO}. Our hybrid model took advantage of robust machine learning algorithms for automatically estimating decision boundaries between behavioural classes. This not only achieved high classification performance but also permitted biomechanical interpretation of classification outcomes. The framework presented here provides the flexibility to adapt models to required levels of behavioural resolution, and has the potential to facilitate meaningful model sharing between studies.},

	abstract = {Selection of relevant and non-redundant features for human activity classification is a crucial task in human activity recognition studies, where researchers try to identify the minimum number of features that can still achieve good classification performance. In this paper, we propose a feature selection method based on guided random forest in the context of human activity recognition. In order to select small set of important features using the guided random forest, we first train an ordinary random forests on the dataset for collecting the feature importance scores, and then, inject the collected importance scores to influence the feature selection process in the guided random forest. The proposed guided random forest has a number of key advantages such as trees in the guided random forest are completely independent from one-another, allows parallel computing, low computational cost as it grows only two ensembles, and can select a very small set of high quality features without losing classification accuracy. Using five benchmark datasets, we show that the guided random forest can select compact feature subsets compared to previously proposed methods, while preserving recognition accuracy. We also apply random forests classifier to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature selection methods and demonstrate that random forests with feature subset selected by guided random forest performs comparatively better than feature subsets selected by other feature selection methods.},

	abstract = {Human Activity Recognition is a promising area having potential to benefit the human society by developing assistive technologies in order to aid elderly, chronically ill and for people with special needs. Accurate activity recognition is challenging because human activity is complex and highly diverse. A comparative study on Human Activity Recognition ({HAR}) dataset based on four methods, Random Forest ({RF}), Support Vector Machines ({SVM}), K-Nearest Neighbors ({KNN}), and Linear Discriminant Analysis ({LDA}) with different features for selecting the best classifier among the models to test the dataset, has been carry out in this paper. The best classifier is choosing by accuracy of the model. We compare the result of dataset with and without important features selection by {RF} methods {varImp}(), Boruta, and Recursive Feature Elimination ({RFE}) to get the best accuracy. From the four methods, we found that the method {RF} have high accuracy from every group (98.16\%, 98.09\%, 93.6\%), which is considered as a best classifier.},
